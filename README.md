What is Prizm?
-------------

Prizm is a decentralized blockchain project built on top of [NXT opesource project](https://bitbucket.org/Jelurida/nxt/src) that provides tools for a decentralized financial platform. Coded in Java, it is rely purely on proof-of-stake for consensus.

Welcome to the Prizm Main Network. This is the main network where the tokens hold value and should be guarded very carefully. If you are testing the network, or developing unstable software on Prizm, we highly recommend using either testnet or regtest mode.
